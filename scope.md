make a todo manager

- let you just look at today's tasks

- send them back to the backlog if they're not done by the end of the day
- keep track of how many times they go back to the backlog and show that number or some graphical representation of it
- keep track of how many days they've been in the backlog and show that number or some graphical representation of it

standard todo list features like:
- list tasks
- add a task
- delete a task
- mark a task as done
- edit a task
- move a task to the backlog (and back)
- group tasks into projects

- some api to add tasks from via http so can have shortcuts on ios for quick add to backlog
-

maybe needs login eventually to allow for multiple devices
database too or maybe theres' a way to do it without a database like

single user only
