make a todo manager




- keep track of how many times they go back to the backlog and show that number or some graphical representation of it
- keep track of how many days they've been in the backlog and show that number or some graphical representation of it




- group tasks into projects

- some api to add tasks from via http so can have shortcuts on ios for quick add to backlog
-

maybe needs login eventually to allow for multiple devices
database too or maybe theres' a way to do it without a database like

single user only
