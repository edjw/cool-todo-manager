## I want this!
- Massive space at the top on narrow screen on safari

## Maybes
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Button to change the order of by date created, number of times added to today, or number of times added to backlog
- Group tasks into projects
- Maybe drag and drop to change order of tasks and today/backlog with dnd-kit
- Print? <https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print>
- add #url fragment-based routing
- do I want a Sometime Filter? Like a real back of the backlog place?

## Nice-to-haves but no big deal
- clean up deleted todos from localstorage if deleted date is more than a week old
- some api to add tasks from via http so can have shortcuts on ios for quick add to backlog. use an astro endpoint with a secret parameter? does kind of make it not single user any more I think?
- maybe needs login eventually to allow for multiple devices
- database too maybe but localstorage is fine for now

## Limitations that I won't change
- single user only
