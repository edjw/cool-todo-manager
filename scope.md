## I want this!
- make it work offline!
- do I want a Sometime Filter? Like a real back of the backlog place?

## Maybes
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Button to change the order of by date created, number of times added to today, or number of times added to backlog
- Group tasks into projects
- Maybe drag and drop to change order of tasks and today/backlog with dnd-kit
- Print? <https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print>
- add #url fragment-based routing


## Nice-to-haves but no big deal

- some api to add tasks from via http so can have shortcuts on ios for quick add to backlog
- maybe needs login eventually to allow for multiple devices
- database too maybe but localstorage is fine for now


## Limitations that I won't change
- single user only
