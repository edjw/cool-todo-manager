## I want this!
- allow copy on the button that is the task title in list and dialog and description of the task in dialog
- notes is too close to the action buttons on dialog
- look at adding select-none to other elements like title, filter title, etc
  Cool Todo Manager
  Today
  Was in Today 1 times
  3 minutes old
  Notes
- sort Today by number of times added to Today
- sort All to always put done at the bottom and in Today at the top
- sort backlog to always put items that have  been in today at the top sorted by the most numbers of times in today
- in All, if an item is in Today, hide the move to Today button
- in All, if an item is in Backlog, hide the move to Backlog button
- Massive space at the top on narrow screen on safari

## Maybes
- some interface for allowing notes to be added at creation time?
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Button to change the order of by date created, number of times added to today, or number of times added to backlog
- Group tasks into projects
- Maybe drag and drop to change order of tasks and today/backlog with dnd-kit
- Print? <https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print>
- add #url fragment-based routing
- do I want a Sometime Filter? Like a real back of the backlog place?

## Nice-to-haves but no big deal
- clean up deleted todos from localstorage if deleted date is more than a week old
- some api to add tasks from via http so can have shortcuts on ios for quick add to backlog. use an astro endpoint with a secret parameter? does kind of make it not single user any more I think?
- maybe needs login eventually to allow for multiple devices
- database too maybe but localstorage is fine for now

## Limitations that I won't change
- single user only
