## I want this!


- keep track of how many times they go back to the backlog and show that number or some graphical representation of it
- keep track of how many days they've been in the backlog and show that number or some graphical representation of it



Make input max width of screen on mobile


Add relative date of how long since date created. Can I do this in a computed store? Maybe just do it in ui for now

Some way of saying how many times itâ€™s been put into today




## Maybes
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Sort tasks by date created, number of times added to today, or number of times added to backlog
- Group tasks into projects
- Maybe drag and drop to reorder tasks
- Print? <https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print>
- add #url fragment-based routing



## Nice-to-haves

- some api to add tasks from via http so can have shortcuts on ios for quick add to backlog
- maybe needs login eventually to allow for multiple devices
- database too maybe but localstorage is fine for now


## Not changing these limitations
- single user only
